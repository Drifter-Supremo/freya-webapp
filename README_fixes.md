# Freya AI Chat - Modular Version Fixes

## What Was Fixed

1. **API Key Validation**: The key validation regex was too strict and didn't accept the project's existing API key format. We've updated it to be more flexible, accepting keys that:
   - Start with "sk-" (including "sk-proj-")
   - Allow hyphens and underscores
   - Have a reasonable minimum length

2. **HTML Button Reference**: Changed the send button from using inline `onclick="sendMessage()"` to using a proper ID selector (`id="send-button"`) that matches what the event handler is looking for in eventListeners.js.

## Key Architectural Changes

### API Key Storage Approach
The biggest architectural change in the modular version is how the API key is handled:

- **Original script.js**: API key was hardcoded in the file
- **Modular version**: API key is stored in localStorage

This provides better security but requires entering the key once when first using the app. The key will be saved in your browser and remembered for future sessions.

### How It Works

1. When you first load the application, it checks localStorage for an API key
2. If no key is found, it displays the API key entry modal
3. Once entered, the key is validated and stored in localStorage
4. All subsequent API calls use this stored key

## Module Structure

The application now has a clean separation of concerns:

- **main.js**: Application entry point and initialization
- **apiLogic.js**: Handles all API communication and key management
- **firebaseLogic.js**: Manages Firebase database connection and operations
- **freyaPrompt.js**: Contains Freya's system prompt definition
- **memoryLogic.js**: Implements the memory system for conversation context
- **uiLogic.js**: Handles UI rendering and display functions
- **eventListeners.js**: Sets up all user interaction event handlers
- **utils.js**: Contains utility functions used across modules

## Testing Guidance

To test the application:

1. Load the application with Live Server (critical for ES modules)
2. Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted
3. Verify the welcome message displays correctly
4. Try sending a message to test the core functionality
5. Use the history button to test Firebase integration
6. Try toggling the theme to verify event handlers

## Note on Browser Console

If you encounter any issues, check the browser's developer console (F12) for error messages. The application has extensive logging that can help diagnose any problems.
