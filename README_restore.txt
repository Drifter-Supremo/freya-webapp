# Freya AI Chat - Restoration Documentation

## What Happened

The application was previously broken during an attempt to refactor the single script.js file into a modular structure. Several issues occurred during this process:

1. The modular structure used ES modules which have different loading requirements than traditional scripts
2. Potential circular dependencies between modules may have caused initialization problems
3. The application could not properly initialize Firebase and other services in the modular format
4. The global functions required by the HTML (like the onclick="sendMessage()") were not properly exposed in the modular format

## Restoration Process

To restore the application to working order:

1. The index.html file was modified to reference the original script.js file again instead of the modular version:
   ```html
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```
   Instead of:
   ```html
   <script type="module" src="js/main.js"></script>
   ```

2. The original script.js file was preserved intact throughout the refactoring attempt, allowing us to revert back to it easily.

## Current Status

The application should now be functioning as it did before the refactoring attempt. The modular code structure is still present in the js/ directory but is not being used.

## Future Considerations

If modularization is still desired in the future, a more incremental approach would be recommended:

1. Start by serving the application through a proper web server (ES modules won't work with file:// URLs)
2. Create one module at a time, thoroughly testing at each step
3. Ensure modules are structured to avoid circular dependencies
4. Properly expose any global functions needed by the HTML

## Original Functionality

The application provides an AI chat interface with Freya, featuring:
- Firebase-based message storage
- OpenAI API integration
- Three-tier memory system
- Theme toggling
- Chat history loading
