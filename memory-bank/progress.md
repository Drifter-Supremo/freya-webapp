## Completed Features

### UI Optimization (Latest)
- [x] Typing Effect Enhancement
  - Optimized animation speeds for better UX
  - Regular characters: 20ms delay (from 30ms)
  - Punctuation pauses: 100ms delay (from 150ms)
  - Added selective application for new messages
  - Preserved animation aesthetics
  - Improved performance with history loading
  - Maintained retro-futuristic feel

### Response Generation Tuning
- [x] Temperature Adjustment
  - Reduced temperature from 1.1 to 0.7
  - Improved response focus and coherence
  - Better balance of personality and control
  - Enhanced conversation quality
  - Maintained character authenticity
  - Verified response improvements

### Memory System Restoration
- [x] Restored Original 3-tier Memory System
  - Re-implemented buildMemoryContext as primary context provider
  - Integrated all three memory tiers:
    * Tier 1: User Facts Database
    * Tier 2: Recent Conversation History
    * Tier 3: Topic-based Memory
  - Ensured system prompt inclusion in every request
  - Added comprehensive logging for verification

- [x] API Logic Refinement
  - Simplified apiLogic.js implementation
  - Removed context-caching and summarization logic
  - Maintained proper role mapping for Gemini API
  - Enhanced error handling and logging
  - Preserved backward compatibility

- [x] Documentation Updates
  - Preserved summarizerLogic.js with clear documentation
  - Updated memory bank documentation
  - Added system architecture explanations
  - Documented implementation details

### Previous Features
- [x] Context Caching System (Archived)
  - Implemented but later replaced by restored 3-tier system
  - Code preserved in summarizerLogic.js for reference
  - Documentation maintained for historical context

- [x] Summarization System (Archived)
  - Created summarizerLogic.js using Gemini 2.0 Flash
  - Implemented message formatting and API integration
  - Added cooldown and trigger mechanisms
  - Code preserved for potential future use

### Core Features (Unchanged)
- [x] Firebase Integration
- [x] Gemini API Integration
- [x] User Interface
- [x] Error Handling
- [x] API Key Management
