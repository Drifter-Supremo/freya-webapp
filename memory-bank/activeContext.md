# Freya AI Chat - Active Context

## Current Focus Areas

As of March 2025, development is focused on these primary areas:

### 1. UI Optimization (Latest)

- **Challenge**: Typing effect needed optimization for better user experience with longer messages.

- **Solution Implemented**: Refined typing animation speeds
  1. Speed Adjustments:
     - Regular characters: 20ms delay (optimized from 30ms)
     - Punctuation pauses: 100ms delay (optimized from 150ms)
     - Maintains readability while improving responsiveness
  
  2. Implementation Details:
     - Updated typeNextChar function in uiLogic.js
     - Preserved animation aesthetics
     - Maintained retro-futuristic feel
     - Added selective application (new messages only)

  3. Technical Implementation:
     - Modified delay timings in displayMessage
     - Added useTypingEffect parameter
     - Optimized history loading performance
     - Preserved existing animation effects

- **Current Status**: Implementation complete and verified
- **Benefits**: 
  - Faster message display
  - Improved user experience
  - Better handling of long responses
  - Maintained visual appeal

### 2. Response Tuning

- **Challenge**: Previous temperature setting (1.1) led to overly verbose and occasionally unfocused responses.

- **Solution Implemented**: Refined response generation
  1. Temperature Adjustment:
     - Reduced from 1.1 to 0.7
     - Better balance between creativity and focus
     - More controlled response generation
     - Maintained personality while improving coherence
  
  2. Impact on Responses:
     - More concise and focused
     - Better topic adherence
     - Reduced tangential content
     - More consistent tone

  3. Technical Implementation:
     - Updated DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE in apiLogic.js
     - Maintained existing token limits
     - Preserved personality system
     - Enhanced response quality

- **Current Status**: Implementation complete and verified
- **Benefits**: 
  - More focused conversations
  - Better response consistency
  - Improved user experience
  - Maintained character authenticity

### 2. Memory System Restoration

- **Challenge**: The previous context-caching implementation, while functional, moved away from Freya's more sophisticated 3-tier memory system.

- **Solution Implemented**: Restored original 3-tier memory system
  1. Memory Architecture:
     - Tier 1: User Facts Database (persistent facts about the user)
     - Tier 2: Recent Conversation History (current conversation context)
     - Tier 3: Topic-based Memory (relevant past conversations)
  
  2. System Integration:
     - Removed context-caching and summarization logic
     - Restored buildMemoryContext as primary context provider
     - Ensured system prompt inclusion in every request
     - Maintained proper role mapping for Gemini API

  3. Code Organization:
     - Simplified apiLogic.js to focus on API interactions
     - Preserved summarizerLogic.js for future reference
     - Enhanced logging for memory context verification
     - Maintained existing error handling

- **Current Status**: Implementation complete and verified
- **Benefits**: 
  - More sophisticated memory management
  - Better context relevance through topic matching
  - Improved user fact tracking
  - Cleaner code organization

### 2. Documentation Updates

The latest documentation effort focused on preserving knowledge while updating system architecture:

- **Challenge**: Need to maintain clear documentation of both current and previous implementations for future reference.

- **Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive documentation updates
  1. Code Documentation:
     - Added clear headers to preserved files
     - Documented previous functionality
     - Updated implementation notes
     - Added system architecture explanations
  
  2. Memory Bank Updates:
     - Updated all relevant documentation files
     - Clarified current system architecture
     - Preserved historical context
     - Added implementation details

- **Current Status**: Documentation updates in progress
- **Benefits**: 
  - Clear system architecture documentation
  - Preserved historical context
  - Easier future maintenance
  - Better development continuity

### Next Steps

1. Testing and Verification:
   - Monitor memory system performance
   - Verify proper fact extraction
   - Test topic-based retrieval
   - Validate context building

2. Potential Enhancements:
   - Improve topic extraction accuracy
   - Enhance user fact categorization
   - Optimize memory retrieval
   - Consider additional memory tiers

3. Future Considerations:
   - Evaluate need for conversation summarization
   - Consider hybrid memory approaches
   - Plan for scaling memory system
   - Explore additional context improvements

## Recent Session Updates
- Migrated API from Gemini to fine-tuned OpenAI GPT-4.1 Mini in js/apiLogic.js.
- Verified Firebase configuration (js/firebaseEnv.js) and confirmed that the "openai" npm dependency is installed.
- Updated documentation in memory-bank files to reflect the migration and configuration verifications.
- Application now ready for further testing.
