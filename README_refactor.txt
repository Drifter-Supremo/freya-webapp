# Freya AI Chat - Code Refactoring Documentation

This document describes the refactoring of the Freya AI Chat application from a single script.js file to a modular, organized code structure.

## Refactored Structure

The codebase has been split into the following modules:

### 1. main.js
- **Purpose**: Central entry point for the application
- **Functionality**: Initializes all other modules and bootstraps the application
- **Key Features**: Firebase initialization, event listener setup, UI initialization, API key validation

### 2. freyaPrompt.js
- **Purpose**: Contains Freya's system prompt for GPT-4o
- **Functionality**: Stores the comprehensive personality, character traits, and behavior guidelines
- **Key Features**: Exports the SYSTEM_PROMPT constant used for API requests

### 3. firebaseLogic.js
- **Purpose**: Manages all Firebase-related functionality
- **Functionality**: Firebase initialization, message storage, history retrieval
- **Key Features**: Firebase configuration, database connection, message saving, history loading

### 4. memoryLogic.js
- **Purpose**: Implements the three-tier memory system
- **Functionality**: User facts extraction, topic detection, context building, memory queries
- **Key Features**: Fact pattern matching, topic extraction, conversation history search, memory context building

### 5. apiLogic.js
- **Purpose**: Handles OpenAI API integration
- **Functionality**: API key management, request formatting, response processing
- **Key Features**: API key storage/retrieval, message formatting, response cleaning, API modal

### 6. uiLogic.js
- **Purpose**: Manages UI-related functionality
- **Functionality**: Message display, status messages, theme toggling
- **Key Features**: Message formatting, status notifications, theme preferences, avatars

### 7. eventListeners.js
- **Purpose**: Centralizes event handling
- **Functionality**: Sets up DOM event listeners, defines event handlers
- **Key Features**: Input events, button clicks, page initialization

### 8. utils.js
- **Purpose**: Provides reusable utility functions
- **Functionality**: Helper methods used across multiple modules
- **Key Features**: Object traversal, throttling/debouncing functions

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each module has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and navigate
3. **Scalability**: New features can be added by extending specific modules
4. **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more manageable
5. **Documentation**: Each module is self-documenting with clear purpose statements
6. **Reusability**: Functions are better organized for potential reuse
7. **Testing**: Isolated modules are easier to test independently

## Implementation Notes

- The ES modules system is used for imports/exports between files
- All modules are located in the `/js` directory for clean organization
- The HTML file has been updated to load the main.js module
- Global scope pollution has been minimized by proper encapsulation
- Original functionality has been preserved with no changes to core behavior

## Usage

The application continues to function exactly as before, with all the same features and capabilities. No user-facing changes were made during this refactoring.
